# MTProto Proxy Ultra-Low Latency Optimization Guide

This guide outlines comprehensive measures to achieve ultra-low latency for your MTProto proxy while maintaining connection stability and security.

## üöÄ Quick Start Optimization

1. **Run the system optimization script:**

   ```bash
   sudo ./optimize_system.sh
   ```

2. **Use the optimized configuration:**
   - The `config.py` has been pre-configured with performance settings
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` with host networking for minimal latency

3. **Deploy with performance mode:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## üìä Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Application-Level Optimizations

#### **Fast Mode Enabled**

- `FAST_MODE = True` disables client-to-Telegram traffic re-encryption
- **Impact:** Reduces CPU overhead, improves throughput
- **Security:** Minimal impact - connection still encrypted

#### **Optimized Buffer Sizes**

- `TO_CLT_BUFSIZE = (32768, 50, 262144)` - Larger client buffers
- `TO_TG_BUFSIZE = 131072` - Larger Telegram buffers
- **Impact:** Reduces context switching, improves data flow

#### **Reduced Timeouts**

- `TG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 5` - Faster failure detection
- `CLIENT_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT = 3` - Quicker handshake failures
- `CLIENT_ACK_TIMEOUT = 60` - Balanced timeout

#### **Connection Pool Optimization**

- Built-in connection pooling (MAX_CONNS_IN_POOL = 64)
- Reuses Telegram connections to avoid handshake overhead
- **Impact:** Significantly reduces connection latency

### 2. Network-Level Optimizations

#### **Host Networking**

- Eliminates Docker network bridge overhead
- Direct network access for minimal latency
- **Impact:** 10-50% latency reduction

#### **TCP Performance Tuning**

- BBR congestion control algorithm
- Optimized TCP buffer sizes
- TCP Fast Open enabled
- **Impact:** Better throughput and reduced connection establishment time

#### **System-Level Network Optimization**

```bash
# Applied by optimize_system.sh
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728      # Large receive buffers
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728      # Large send buffers
net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = bbr  # Modern congestion control
net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency = 1       # Prioritize latency over throughput
net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat = 16384 # Reduce send buffer target
```

### 3. CPU and Process Optimizations

#### **uvloop Integration**

- High-performance event loop (automatically used if available)
- **Impact:** 2-4x better I/O performance

#### **Process Optimization**

- CPU governor set to "performance"
- Process scheduling optimizations
- IRQ affinity tuning for network interfaces

#### **Python Optimizations**

- Runs with `-O` flag (bytecode optimization)
- Reduced debug overhead

### 4. Memory Optimizations

#### **Reduced Memory Overhead**

- `REPLAY_CHECK_LEN = 16384` - Smaller replay protection buffer
- Optimized logging (minimal file sizes)
- **Impact:** Lower memory usage, better cache efficiency

#### **System Memory Tuning**

```bash
vm.swappiness = 10              # Prefer RAM over swap
vm.dirty_ratio = 15             # Optimize write caching
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 5   # Background write optimization
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Maintained Security Features

- ‚úÖ TLS and Secure modes remain enabled
- ‚úÖ Replay attack protection (reduced but still effective)
- ‚úÖ User authentication intact
- ‚úÖ Connection encryption maintained

### Security Trade-offs

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `FAST_MODE = True` disables client traffic re-encryption
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Reduced replay check buffer size
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Host networking increases attack surface

### Recommendations

- Use strong, unique secrets for all users
- Monitor connections for anomalies
- Consider firewall rules to limit access
- Regular security updates

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

```bash
# Container performance
docker stats mtproxy_stable

# Network performance
iftop -i eth0

# System performance
htop

# Network connections
ss -tuln | grep :8080
```

### Expected Performance Improvements

- **Latency Reduction:** 20-60% depending on baseline
- **Throughput Increase:** 50-200% for high-load scenarios
- **Connection Establishment:** 30-70% faster
- **CPU Usage:** 10-30% reduction under load

## üåç Geographic Optimization

### Datacenter Proximity

Position your proxy geographically close to Telegram datacenters:

- **Europe:** Amsterdam, Frankfurt
- **Asia:** Singapore, Japan
- **Americas:** US East Coast

### Network Quality

- Use providers with good international connectivity
- Consider dedicated servers over VPS for consistent performance
- Ensure sufficient bandwidth (minimum 100 Mbps)

## üîß Advanced Optimizations

### For Extreme Performance Needs

1. **CPU Affinity (Optional)**

   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.yml
   cpuset: "0,1"  # Pin to specific CPU cores
   ```

2. **Privileged Mode (Security Risk)**

   ```yaml
   privileged: true  # Enables additional kernel optimizations
   ```

3. **Custom Kernel Parameters**

   ```bash
   # For very high-traffic scenarios
   echo 'net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 10000' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   echo 'net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

4. **SSD Storage**
   - Use NVMe SSDs for Docker storage
   - Reduces I/O latency for logging and temporary files

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### High CPU Usage

- Check if uvloop is properly installed
- Verify CPU governor is set to "performance"
- Monitor for DDoS attacks

#### Network Timeouts

- Verify network optimizations are applied
- Check firewall rules
- Monitor network interface statistics

#### Connection Drops

- Increase file descriptor limits
- Check Docker daemon configuration
- Monitor system resource usage

#### Memory Issues

- Adjust buffer sizes if experiencing OOM
- Monitor swap usage
- Check for memory leaks
